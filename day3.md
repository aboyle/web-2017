# Day 3. Data Analysis and Graphics with R

Today we will be working with the R language and environment for statistical computing, data analysis and graphics.  

Developing code in R is a back-and-forth between writing code in a rerunnable script and exploring data interactively in the R interpreter. To be reproducible, all steps that lead to results you’ll use later must be recorded in an R script that accompanies your analysis and interactive work.  

Before getting our hands dirty working with real data in R, we need to learn the basics of the R language. Even if you’ve poked around in R and seen these concepts before, I would still recommend you follow along and complete the free online interactive learning tutorial [“TryR” (http://tryr.codeschool.com)](http://tryr.codeschool.com). This will take you through a gentle introduction to R syntax and some of the major R data structures (called vectors, matrices and data.frames).
